NCAA March Madness Predictor
----------------------------

To people who stumbled across this, beware this is not my best work.  I put together something hacky to read in
data from a data file and spit out some information about how various NCAA prediction strategies work.

To run it (and see the help text) simply give:

  ./ncaa_simulations.py

Or

  python3 ncaa_simulations.py

A whirl.

The data it is expecting is a CSV file with the schema defined at www.hoopstournament.net/Database.html.

Enjoy!
